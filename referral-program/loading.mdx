This document is part of a 3-part guide for integrating the Reditus Referral Program In-App Widget. In this first step, we’ll cover how to **load** the widget into your application. Loading the widget is essential because it brings in the necessary JavaScript and exposes the functions you’ll need to display referral information to your users.

## Overview

The Reditus referral widget is loaded via the [**Pageview Tracking Script**](<(https://app.getreditus.com/saas/settings/installation)>), that should already be installed in your app.

You should add the following snippet **where your frontend has access to user data and the JWT token from your backend**. Once you invoke the `gr("loadReferralWidget", ...)` method, it automatically fetches the referral program code and makes the widget available through `window.referralWidget`.

## Example Usage

```javascript Javascript
const authToken = await fetchAuthToken();

window.gr("loadReferralWidget", {
  product_id: PRODUCT_ID,
  auth_token: authToken,
  user_details: {
    email: "john@example.com",
    first_name: "John",
    last_name: "Doe",
    company_id: "1as2-3df4-5fg6-7hj8",
    company_name: "Acme",
  },
});
```

Once called, the script fetches the referral widget and attaches it to window.referralWidget, allowing you to interact with it in your application.
