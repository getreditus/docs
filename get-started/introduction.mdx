# Get started with the Reditus Platform

The Reditus Platform helps you maximize your affiliate or in-app referral program. From recruiting your first affiliate, to generating substantial revenue for your B2B SaaS company.

It also empowers affiliates—like publishers, bloggers, and influencers—to earn more by promoting B2B SaaS companies.

Use this section to get familiar with the platform.


## How the platform is organized

The Reditus platform is organized into two products:
1. Affiliate Program
2. Referral Program

We put together a different getting started section for eah of these products, however some steps apply to both.

## Affiliate Program

All you need in one place to get started with your affiliate program. It allows you to recruit, manage, motivate and pay your affiliates.

### Affiliate Program API

The Affiliate Program API has a set of endpoints which can be used to understand the data around your affiliate program.

You can access the different resources including:

- Affiliates (Partners)
- Partnerships
- Referrals
- Payments
- Tracking

### Affiliates API

The Affiliates API is a tool to be used by affiliates or publishers, to get a deeper understanding of their partnerships, programatically.

You can access the different resources including:

- Clicks
- Referrals
- Commissions
- Sub IDs

## Referral Program

The Referral Program is our newest product, and allows you to create and manage your in-app referral program.

### Referral Program API

You can access the different resources including:

- Advocates (users promoting you)
- Leads (These are simply **referrals**. We wanted to have a clear distinction between these and the affiliate program referrals)
