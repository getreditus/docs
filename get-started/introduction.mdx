# Get started with the Reditus Platform

The Reditus Platform helps B2B SaaS companies to set up, manage and maximise their affiliate or in-app referral program. With our platform you can set up the tracking, and recruit affiliates outside of your own network, all with the goal of growing your MRR.

See below more general information about the platform. Want to see the API’s directly? Use the toggles at top of the screen.


## How the platform is organized

The Reditus platform is organized into two products:
1. Affiliate Program
2. Referral Program

As they are treated as two separate products, we have created two different sections for them. Good to know; they do use the same tracking mechanisms.

## Affiliate Program

Want to grow by leveraging people outside your own network / userbase? Than the affiliate program is the best fit for you. We will help you to set up an affiliate program, manage & recruiting affiliates, track all payments and handle the payouts towards affiliates.

### Affiliate Program API

The Affiliate Program API has a set of endpoints which can be used to understand the data around your affiliate program.

You can access the different resources including:

- Affiliates (Partners)
- Partnerships
- Referrals
- Payments
- Tracking

### Affiliates API

The Affiliates API is a tool to be used by affiliates or publishers, to get a deeper understanding of their partnerships, programatically.

You can access the different resources including:

- Clicks
- Referrals
- Commissions
- Sub IDs

## Referral Program

The In-app Referral Program is a way to automatically generate a referral link for your users, where they can start recommending you from within YOUR app. They don’t need to sign up to our platform, and we would provide you with all the information needed.

It is a great way to create a viral loop within your own app.


### Referral Program API

You can access the different resources including:

- Advocates (users promoting you)
- Leads (These are simply **referrals**. We wanted to have a clear distinction between these and the affiliate program referrals)
