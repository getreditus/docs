# What is the tracking script?

The tracking script is essential for monitoring affiliate conversions on your website. It tracks when someone clicks an affiliate link and completes a sign-up. After an affiliate link is clicked, a cookie üç™ is placed on the user's device. You control the duration of this cookie in your dashboard.

## How to install?

**The script must be added on all pages and subdomains.**

## Script structure

Do **not** use this script directly. Use the one you have in your [dashboard](https://app.getreditus.com/saas/settings/installation).

```
  <script>
  (function (w, d, s, p, t) {
    w.gr = w.gr || function () {
      w.gr.ce = 60; w.gr.q = w.gr.q || []; w.gr.q.push(arguments);
    };
    p = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
    t = d.createElement(s); t.async = true; t.src = "https://script.getreditus.net/v2.js"; p.parentNode.insertBefore(t, p); })(window, document, "script");
    gr("initCustomer", "YOUR-REDITUS-UID");
    gr("track", "pageview");
  </script>
```
