# Advanced Integration (Stripe or API only)

To enhance tracking accuracy, we recommend including an additional parameter in the email. Since email addresses can change over time, having a stable identifier ensures consistency.


## Stripe Integration

### Stripe Customer ID

You can use the Stripe Customer ID you receive from the `customer.created` Stripe event, and use it in the Reditus snippet.

```
window.gr("track", "conversion", { email: "actual@email.com", uid: "cus_123456" }); // Use the actual Stripe Customer ID
```

### Internal User ID

Similarly, you can use your own internal ID of the user. After a user signs up on your platform, trigger the `customer.created` Stripe event and include the `user_id` in the metadata—ideally right after the signup snippet.

```
{
  "id": "evt_1Example1234567890",
  "object": "event",
  "api_version": "2023-10-16",
  "created": 1707859200,
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "id": "cus_1234567890abcdef",
      "object": "customer",
      "metadata": {
          "user_id": "your-internal-customer-id" // Matching is done against this field
      },
    }
  },
  "type": "customer.created"
}
```

**Important:** If the signup snippet runs after the customer.created Stripe event, it must happen within **30 seconds** to ensure the Stripe customer is correctly matched with the referral.

```
window.gr("track", "conversion", { email: "actual@email.com", uid: "your-internal-user-customer-id" });
```

## API Integration

If you’re using the API, ensure you're on **V2 of the Tracking API** and include the `uid` parameter.
