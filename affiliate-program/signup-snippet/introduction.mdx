# What is the Signup Snippet?

The Reditus Sign-up Snippet is a single line of JS code that should be triggered after a successful sign-up.

This snippet sends Reditus the email (or uid) of the person who signed up, ideally right after registration or when onboarding flow started.

```
  gr('track', 'conversion', { email: "email@example.com", uid: "1234-abcd });
```

**Make sure to replace the email and uid with the actual user data.**


## How to install?

**Before installing the snippet, ensure that you have already added the tracking script to your page.**

The `gr` function is only available if you already installed the Tracking Script.
